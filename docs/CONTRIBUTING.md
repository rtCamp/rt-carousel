# Contributing to rtCarousel

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We welcome all contributions, from bug reports to feature requests and code changes.

## Development Workflow

1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  **Clone** your fork locally.
3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    composer install
    ```
4.  **Create a branch** for your feature or fix:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature
    ```
5.  **Make your changes**.
6.  **Commit your changes** using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: add amazing new slide effect"
    ```
    *Note: We use `commitlint` to enforce this standard. Your commit will fail if the message is invalid.*
7.  **Push** to your fork.
8.  **Open a Pull Request**.

## Code Standards

- **PHP**: We follow WordPress Coding Standards (WPCS). Run `composer run lint` to check.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: We use the standard WordPress ESLint config. Run `npm run lint:js` to check.
- **CSS/SCSS**: We use Stylelint. Run `npm run lint:css` to check.

## Block `save()` Changes

If your changes modify a block's `save()` output — including `data-wp-context`, HTML structure, class names, or new elements — you **must** add a deprecation entry in the block's `deprecated.tsx`.

1. Copy the previous `save()` function into the `deprecated` array.
2. Include the `attributes` and `supports` from the old version (copy the full `supports` from `block.json` — don't simplify it, or alignment/color classes will fail validation).
3. For blocks with inner blocks, use `useInnerBlocksProps.save()` in the deprecated `save()` function, just like the current save does.

Without this, existing content will show "Block contains unexpected or invalid content" errors in the editor.

See the [Block Deprecation API](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-deprecation/) for details.

## Building the Plugin

To create a production-ready ZIP file:

```bash
make zip
```

This will create `rt-carousel.zip` in the project root, optimized for distribution (no dev dependencies).
