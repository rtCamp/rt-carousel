A modular, high-performance carousel block for WordPress, powered by the Interactivity API and Embla Carousel.

== Description ==

**rtCarousel** is a flexible, accessible carousel block for the WordPress block editor. Build dynamic carousels for posts, testimonials, images, and more—without writing code.

= Features =

* **Compound Block Architecture** – Mix and match any blocks inside the carousel
* **High Performance** – Powered by Embla Carousel v8
* **Interactivity API** – Reactive state management with zero hydration overhead
* **Query Loop Support** – Each post in a Query Loop becomes a slide automatically
* **Accessibility** – W3C-compliant roles, labels, and keyboard navigation
* **RTL Support** – Built-in support for Right-to-Left languages

= Block Components =

1. **Carousel** – The main wrapper and controller
2. **Carousel Viewport** – The visible scrolling area
3. **Carousel Slide** – Container for individual slides
4. **Carousel Controls** – Previous/Next navigation buttons
5. **Carousel Dots** – Pagination indicators

= Use Cases =

* Image galleries and sliders
* Testimonial carousels
* Post/product showcases
* Logo showcases
* Hero banners with multiple slides

= Source Code =

This plugin release includes transpiled production assets for performance. The complete, human-readable source code is publicly available at:

* https://github.com/rtCamp/rt-carousel

Build scripts, development files, and original TypeScript/JavaScript/PHP sources are maintained in that repository.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `rt-carousel` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress
3. In the block editor, search for "Carousel" and insert the block

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with Full Site Editing? =

Yes! rtCarousel is fully compatible with FSE. Use it in templates, template parts, and anywhere blocks are supported.

= Can I nest other blocks inside slides? =

Absolutely. Each slide accepts any WordPress block—images, paragraphs, groups, columns, and third-party blocks.

= Does it support the Query Loop block? =

Yes. Add a Query Loop inside the Carousel Viewport, and each post becomes a slide automatically.

= Is it accessible? =

Yes. The carousel follows W3C accessibility guidelines with proper ARIA roles, labels, and full keyboard navigation.

= Can I have multiple carousels on the same page? =

Yes. Each carousel instance maintains its own independent state.

= I am using "Carousel Kit". How do I upgrade to rtCarousel? =

rtCarousel is the successor to Carousel Kit. Simply install and activate rtCarousel — it will automatically migrate all existing carousel blocks in your content. You will see an admin notice prompting you to deactivate the old Carousel Kit plugin. After deactivating it, you can safely delete it.
